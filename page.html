   <h1> My name is Lidia Ramirez Ramirez.</h1>
   <h2> I am 20 years old. </h2>
   <h3> I have a daughter of 1 year old.</h3>
   <h4> I am a college student at San Diego City College  and currently taking a full stack development program at San Diego Global Knowledge University.</h4>
   
    
   <p> I was born in Leon, Gto, Mexico. I moved to San Diego when is was nine years old. I came with no knowledge of the english language. It took me two years to full understand the language. I finished my elementary, middle school, and high school here in San Diego. I took two years off college because I got pregnant. I am happily working as an administrative assistant at San Diego Global Knowledge University. I have planned to stay there untill I finish my career as a mathematician and/or if I get to find a job as a web developer. Which ever comes first. </p>
   

    This is a little bit about me!!!
